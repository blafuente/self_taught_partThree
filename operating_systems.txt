Operating Systems

Every computer has an operating system-- a program that is middleman between the physical components of 
the computer and you.

There are three popular operating systems for desktop and laptop computers: Windows, Unix, and Linux. 
Windows is Microsoft's opearting system. Unix is an opearting system creating in the 1970s. Apple based 
their opearting system on Unix. Linux is open-source operating system used by the majority of the world's servers.
A server is a computer or computer program that performs tasks, like hosting a website. 
Open-source means a company or individual does not own the software and you may redistribute or modify it. 
Linux and Unix are both Unix-like operating systems, which means they are very similar. 

In this section of the course of the course, you will learn about different programming tools. 
One of the tools you will learn abuot is called Bash. Bash is only available on Unix and Linux
operating systems: it is not available on Windows. Instructor covers Bash, even though it is not available 
on Windows, for two reasons. The first is that technology companies tend to use either Linux or Unix because 
they are more friendly for programmers. The second is that no matter what operating system you use, 
at some point you will need to learn how to use Bash because almost every server in the world runs on Linux,
and as a programmer, you will come into contact with a lot of servers.
